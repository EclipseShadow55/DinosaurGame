# Centered at the origin

# Vertices (v x y z)
# These coordinates place the vertices such that the tetrahedron is regular
# and oriented with one vertex pointing up along the Y-axis.

# Vertex Normals (vn x y z)
# For a regular tetrahedron, each face is an equilateral triangle.
# We define a normal for each face. Since it's a "hard-edged" object,
# we generally don't share vertex normals across faces at the same point
# if we want sharp edges. Instead, each face will have its own normal.
# The normals point outwards from the center of the tetrahedron.

# Faces (f v)
# Each face is an equilateral triangle.
# The order of vertices for a face determines its normal direction (counter-clockwise for outward-facing, typically).
# The indices are 1-based. v//vn means no texture coordinate.
